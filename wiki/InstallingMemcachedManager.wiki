This is currently the only way to try out Memcached-Manager. It should be pretty simple for anyone with a bit of programming experience.

{{{
# SVN Checkout
svn checkout http://memcached-manager.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/src/ memcached-manager

# Change Directory into the newly checkout code
cd memcached-manager

# Execute MemcachedManager
python MemcachedManager.py
}}}

== Download ==

Currently their is no downloads available. Their should soon me Tar.gz & Deb packages to download and install. If you are an RPM fan and would like to build a package for that, it would be much appreciated.
